# Carbon Atlas — Deliverables

**The single source of truth.** Roadmap, task list, AI prompts, file changes, conventions and
session history. Everything else in this folder is linked from here.

**Window:** 19 August → 28 September 2026 · **Team:** Dev, Dev, Dev · **Cadence:** weekly delivery

## Index

| Document | What it answers |
|---|---|
| **Deliverables.md** *(this file)* | What we build, by when, who has it, and the prompt to build it with |
| [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md) | A user in many tenants, companies and branches — and how "web but not mobile" is enforced |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | The services, the data model, isolation, and what already exists |
| [INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md](./INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md) | **Binding.** How a screen talks to a microservice |
| [CONFIGURABILITY.md](./CONFIGURABILITY.md) | **Binding.** Whether a thing becomes a column, a configurable field, a rule, a catalogue row or code — and what each costs to support |
| [RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md](./RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md) | The cross-industry rule and workflow taxonomy, for all seven verticals |
| [EU-BIOMETHANE.md](./EU-BIOMETHANE.md) | The biomethane domain in depth: RED III, UDB, ETS, CSRD — with the calculations |
| [OFFSET.md](./OFFSET.md) | The offset planning engine, and why it differs per branch and location |
| [COST.md](./COST.md) | Unit economics, subscription design, and how a price is computed |
| [COMPETITORS.md](./COMPETITORS.md) | Twenty-one competitors, where they are strong, and the gaps worth taking |

> **Where this folder lives.** In `Carbon-atlas-webapp/` because the repository root is not version
> controlled, and a source of truth that is not versioned is not a source of truth. It covers all
> three repositories despite living in one. Moving it to a dedicated docs repository is one command —
> every internal link is relative.

## How to use this file

**Starting a session**

1. Read [Session log](#session-log) — the last entry says where work stopped.
2. Read [Ground truth](#ground-truth-what-already-exists). Most of the backend is built; the single
   most expensive mistake available here is rebuilding something that already works.
3. Find your task in the [Roadmap](#roadmap) by ID (`F1`, `A12`, `C8`…).
4. Copy the matching prompt from [AI prompts](#ai-prompts) into a fresh agent session.

**Finishing a task**

1. Tick the row in the roadmap (`☐` → `☑`).
2. Update or create the `GUIDE.md` in the feature folder you touched.
3. Add a [Session log](#session-log) entry: what landed, what did not, what the next person needs.

**Developers may edit this file directly.** Add rows, change estimates, leave notes in Comments. It
is the plan of record, not a generated artefact.

**Business team.** Read [Scope reality check](#scope-reality-check), the weekly deliveries, and then
[COST.md](./COST.md) and [EU-BIOMETHANE.md](./EU-BIOMETHANE.md).

---

## Scope reality check

29 working days × 3 developers × ~6 productive hours ≈ **522 hours**, minus the freeze day ≈ **504**.

Roughly double the original window, and it changes the answer: **most of the requirement now fits**,
including rules, workflow and a biomethane vertical slice for Ace. What still does not fit is in
[Deferred backlog](#deferred-backlog) with an estimate against each item, so deferring stays a
decision rather than a discovery.

Two structural risks, both cheaper to accept than to discover:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`UNIT` scope does not exist yet** | A sixth level below INDUSTRY, touching every resolver. Done in one change (`T1`) it is a day; discovered piecemeal it is a second resolution order that disagrees with the first, surfacing months later as "why is this field on the form". |
| **Payment gateway and invoice generation are not built** | The entities exist; the integration does not. Both are on the W4 critical path, and a slipped gateway means invoice screens ship read-only. |

---

## Ground truth: what already exists

**Do not rebuild these.** The backend for most of the requirement is done and tested. The bulk of
the remaining work is **web UI over existing APIs**.

| Capability | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Auth: register, login, forgot/reset/change, OTP, refresh, `/me` | ✅ built | `al.auth/Api/AuthEndpoints.cs` |
| Auth: challenge/nonce pre-login, single re-challenge | ✅ built | `al.auth/Services/LoginChallengeService.cs` |
| Four Ace users — RBAC assignments **and** login identities | ✅ built | `al.master/Data/AceTenantSeeder.cs`, `al.auth/Data/AceUserSeeder.cs` |
| Tenant list & context switch (`/auth/tenants`, `/auth/context/switch`) | ✅ built | `al.auth`, `useSwitchContext.hook.ts` |
| RBAC: roles, permissions, route rules, scope assignment | ✅ built | `al.master`, `al.net.authorization` |
| Membership grant model (application dimension, validity, grant type) | ✅ built | `al.net.entities/Identity/Grant.cs`, `al.master/Api/GrantEndpoints.cs` |
| Tenant / company / branch / industry catalogues | ✅ built | `al.net.entities/Master` |
| **UNIT** scope level | ❌ missing everywhere | task `T1` — blocks `T4`, `C4`, `D3` |
| Subscription plans, trial, provisioning snapshots | ✅ built | `al.subscription` |
| Quota: definition, scope resolution, enforcement | ✅ built | `al.net.data/Authorization/EfQuotaGuard.cs` |
| Wallet: scoped, nearest-first burn | ✅ built | `al.net.entities/Billing/Wallet.cs` |
| Promo codes, discounts, time windows | ✅ built | `al.net.entities/Billing/PromoCode.cs` |
| Invoice / PaymentProvider / PaymentTransaction **entities** | ✅ built | `al.net.entities/Billing` |
| Payment **gateway integration** | ❌ missing | task `C8` |
| Invoice **generation** | ❌ missing | task `C10` |
| Provider bindings — DB-driven, per scope, per channel | ✅ built | `al.net.data/Registry/EfProviderBindingResolver.cs` |
| UDF **metadata engine** — resolution, scope, i18n, tooltips, sections, conditions, static-field catalogue, validator | ✅ built | `al.net.udf`, `al.udf` |
| UDF **data plane** — `custom_fields` jsonb + GIN on company and branch, fail-closed save interceptor, validation over HTTP for services with no document store | ✅ built | `al.master`, `al.udf` |
| UDF **definition versioning** — every edit archives the outgoing revision; values keep the revision they were captured under and are still validated by it | ✅ built | `al.net.udf` |
| UDF **consumed by a screen** — no React screen renders a resolved form; `CompanyOnboardingPage` still hand-codes from `@/mocks/mockForms` | ❌ missing | task `T3` |
| UDF **form builder wired to UDF** — `/form-builder` is 25 files of localStorage with zero UDF references | ❌ missing | task `D1a` |
| UDF for **list/table views** (columns per scope) | ❌ missing | task `D2` |
| Rules engine | ✅ built | `al.net.rules`, `al.rules` |
| Workflow engine | ✅ built | `al.net.workflow`, `al.workflow` |
| Rules/workflow **authoring UI** | ❌ missing | `R1`–`R4`, `W1`–`W4` |
| Emission calculation engine | ◐ partial | `E1`–`E4` |
| Offset planning engine | ◐ partial | `O1`–`O3` |
| Bulk import/export + review grid | ✅ built | `al.ingestion`, `packages/react/src/forms/bulk` |
| Web: auth screens, DataGrid, DynamicForm, api-client, UDF adapters | ✅ built | `apps/web`, `packages/react` |
| Web: design tokens, app shell, error boundary, diagnostics | ❌ missing | `F1`, `F2`, `F3` |

## Backend gaps that block UI

Schedule these first. A UI task blocked on a missing API stalls a developer for a day.

| ID | Gap | Blocks | Week |
|---|---|---|---|
| `A6` | Membership grant model | `A12`, `A14`, `A15` | W1 |
| `A7` | Application gating at token issuance | mobile access control everywhere | W1 |
| `T1` | `UNIT` scope across entities, resolvers, migrations | `T4`, `C4`, `D3`, `R2` | W2 |
| `C3` | Pricing engine | `C5`, `C10` | W4 |
| `C8` | Payment gateway | `C11`, `C13` | W4 |
| `C10` | Invoice generation | `C13` | W4 |
| `D2` | UDF for list/table views | the config UI half of `D2` | W3 |
| `R0` | EU requirement extraction | `R3`, `B2`, `B6` | W5 |

---

## Scope model

```
PLATFORM  →  TENANT  →  COMPANY  →  BRANCH  →  INDUSTRY  →  UNIT
                                    ×
                       APPLICATION (web | mobile | api)
```

`APPLICATION` is **orthogonal**, not a level: the same branch shows five fields on web and three on
mobile. It breaks ties at the same organisational level; it does not sit inside the hierarchy.

**Specificity weights** — existing in `UdfScopes.Specificity`, extended by `T1`:

```
BRANCH 8 · COMPANY 4 · INDUSTRY 2 · APPLICATION 1                   ← today
UNIT 16 · BRANCH 8 · COMPANY 4 · INDUSTRY 2 · APPLICATION 1         ← after T1
```

One resolution order across the whole platform, deliberately. A second would eventually disagree
with the first.

**Permissions union; configuration resolves most-specific-wins; denials beat both.** The rule most
likely to be implemented backwards — see [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md).

**Downstream may not exceed upstream.** A tenant with a 1 TB allocation may divide it as it likes,
but the sum below can never exceed the ceiling above. That is `C4`, and it is the most-tested rule
in the commerce track.

---

## Conventions

### Documentation

Every feature folder carries a `GUIDE.md`, matching the `README.md` convention the SDK packages and
services already follow.

```
apps/web/src/features/<feature>/GUIDE.md
packages/react/src/<area>/README.md
```

A `GUIDE.md` answers, in order: **what this is for**, **the decisions that shape it and what the
alternatives cost**, **how to use it**, **the pitfalls**. Not an API dump — the types are the API
dump. `packages/react/src/forms/udf/README.md` is the reference for tone and depth.

**A task is not done until its `GUIDE.md` is current.** Documentation written a week later is
written from memory, and the reason a decision was made is the first thing memory loses.

### Folder shape

```
apps/web/src/features/<feature>/
├── GUIDE.md
├── api/            <feature>.api.ts, use<Feature>.ts       ← models + hooks
├── components/     presentational, no data fetching
├── pages/          route targets, wiring only
├── hooks/
├── utils/
├── types/
└── __tests__/
```

### Request / response models

One file per service, mirroring the wire, hand-maintained and commented.
`apps/web/src/api/udf.api.ts` is the reference. Hand-maintained rather than generated is a deliberate
cost: it is the only place the two sides meet, so it is worth being able to read.

- **Never send tenant, company, branch or application.** They come from the token. A client that can
  name its own tenant can read another customer's data — a defect this platform shipped with once.
- Query keys in `apps/web/src/api/queryKeys.ts`. **Every response-changing parameter goes in the
  key**, scope and culture included.
- Staleness from `STALE`; never a literal.

[INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md](./INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md) is binding, not advisory.

### Reusable components

New UI goes in `packages/react` when a second feature could plausibly want it, and in
`apps/web/src/components` when it is genuinely one screen's. Bias toward the package: promoting later
is a moved file; not promoting is a second implementation that drifts.

---

## Design system

**shadcn/ui + Tailwind**, already in `packages/react/src/forms/components/ui`. Extend it; do not
introduce a second component library.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Theme** | Light-first with a full dark palette. Tokens on bare `:root`, redefined under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and `[data-theme="dark"]` so an explicit toggle wins both ways. |
| **Brand** | Existing `brand-*` scale — carbon greens and slate, with a warm accent on commerce surfaces so "you are about to spend money" reads differently from "you are configuring something". |
| **Density** | Compact by default. An operator console people live in all day; vertical space is the scarce resource. |
| **Motion** | Purposeful only — state transitions, optimistic feedback, progress. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| **Illustration** | AI-generated SVG/GIF approved for empty states, onboarding and success moments. Inline or data URIs; no external hosts. |
| **Feel** | The "living" quality comes from **responsiveness and honesty**, not decoration: optimistic updates, skeletons matching the real layout, progress that names its phase, errors that say what to do next. A page that explains why a button is disabled feels better built than one that animates. |

---

## Weekly delivery, not sprints

Every Friday something works end to end and can be shown — not a demo of components, a path a person
can walk.

| Week | Days | Theme | **Friday delivery** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W1** | 19–21 Aug *(3 days)* | Foundation | Themed shell, error pages with diagnostic reporting, scope switcher |
| **W2** | 24–28 Aug | Identity & access | Sign in as any of the four Ace users; navigation, data and available applications differ |
| **W3** | 31 Aug – 4 Sep | Tenancy & provisioning | Provision tenant → company → branch → industry → unit, end to end |
| **W4** | 7–11 Sep | Commerce | Buy a plan with add-ons and quota; live pricing, promo, wallet, invoice |
| **W5** | 14–18 Sep | Configuration & rules | Build a form from the builder; author a rule and dry-run it; calculate emissions |
| **W6** | 21–25 Sep | Workflow, billing, biomethane | Run a biomethane batch through approval; produce an invoice and an offset plan |
| **W7** | 28 Sep *(1 day)* | Freeze | Tagged, deployed, smoke-tested |

**Why weekly and not fortnightly.** Six of the seven weeks carry a hard external dependency —
regulatory rules, a payment gateway, a certifier's data shape. A two-week loop finds a wrong
assumption on day ten; a one-week loop finds it on day four, with five weeks left to absorb it.

`O` offset · `G` governance & release

### W1 — Foundation · 19–21 Aug

*Delivery: a themed shell with working error handling and a scope switcher.*

| ☐ | Date | Dev | Module | Task & subtasks | Cx | Hrs | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | 19 Aug | Dev - RS | Foundation | `F1` **Design tokens & theme** — light/dark triple definition; brand scale; density; motion under `prefers-reduced-motion` | M | 4 | Everything else consumes this. Never define a colour only inside a media query. |
| ☐ | 19 Aug | Dev-AG | Foundation | `F3` **Error handling & diagnostics** — error boundary; 403/404/500; diagnostic report with **recursive redaction** | H | 4 | A diagnostic shipping a token or PII is a breach, not a feature. |
| ◐ | 19 Aug | Dev - VR | Identity | `A6` **Membership grant model (backend)** — one grant table; scope columns, application, validity, grant type, descendants | H | 4 | The spine of W2. See [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md). |
| ◐ | 20 Aug | Dev - VR | Foundation | `F2` **App shell** — sidebar, top bar, ⌘K palette, breadcrumbs; **nav hides on missing permission** | M | 4 | Mount `TenantSwitcher` here — built last session, not yet placed. |
| ☐ | 20 Aug | Dev | Identity | `A7` **Application gating** — refuse token issuance for an application with no grant; `app` claim; route check | H | 4 | The "web but not mobile" requirement, enforced at issuance rather than in the UI. |
| ◐ | 20 Aug | Dev - RS | Foundation | `F5` **Scope context** — PLATFORM→UNIT + application; switcher; **scope in every query key**; invalidate on switch | H | 4 | A cache surviving a scope switch shows another company's data. |
| ☐ | 21 Aug | Dev | Identity | `A8` **Effective-access resolver** — union for permissions, most-specific-wins for settings, deny beats both | H | 4 | The union/most-specific split is the subtle part. |
| ◐ | 21 Aug | Dev - RS | Foundation | `F7` **Shared UI primitives** — page header, empty state, stat tile, scope badge, confirm dialog, drawer, illustration slot | M | 4 | Into `packages/react`, not `apps/web`. |
| ☐ | 21 Aug | Dev | Foundation | `F4` **Model & hook conventions** — extend the integration standard; scaffold script; scope-aware query-key helper | L | 3 | Land before others write API files. |

### W2 — Identity & access · 24–28 Aug

*Delivery: sign in as any of the four Ace users; navigation, data and applications differ correctly.*

| ☐ | Date | Dev | Module | Task & subtasks | Cx | Hrs | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☐ | 24 Aug | Dev | Auth | `A9` **Tenant & company chooser** — post-login selection when membership spans several; skip when there is one | M | 4 | `/auth/tenants` and `/auth/context/switch` exist. This is the screen. |
| ☐ | 24 Aug | Dev | RBAC | `A10` **Roles UI** — list, create, edit, clone, scope badge; delete refused while assigned, with the list shown | M | 4 | Follow the UDF definition-delete pattern. |
| ☐ | 24 Aug | Dev | RBAC | `A11` **Permission catalogue UI** — resource/action tree, route rules, search; platform rows read-only *with a reason* | M | 4 | |
| ☐ | 25 Aug | Dev | Identity | `A12` **Membership management UI** — grant access at any level, for named applications, with validity dates | H | 4 | The screen the whole identity model exists for. |
| ☐ | 25 Aug | Dev | RBAC | `A13` **Role→permission matrix** — bulk toggle, inherited vs explicit, **diff before save** | H | 4 | A matrix saved blind is how privilege creeps. |
| ☐ | 25 Aug | Dev | RBAC | `A14` **Effective-permission preview** — pick a user and a scope; see what they can do and *which grant said so* | H | 4 | Provenance is the feature. |
| ☐ | 26 Aug | Dev | Identity | `A15` **Parent/sub-tenant hierarchy** — parent link, `IncludesDescendants`, aggregated read for parent admins | H | 4 | Test all three directions. The sibling one ships broken. |
| ☐ | 26 Aug | Dev | Auth | `A16` **MFA enrolment** — TOTP enrol, verify, recovery codes; **mandatory for admin roles** | H | 4 | Backend has `MfaEnabled`. Policy is per role, per scope. |
| ☐ | 26 Aug | Dev | Identity | `A17` **Users management** — invite, deactivate, resend, view a user's grants across tenants | M | 4 | |
| ☐ | 27 Aug | Dev | Identity | `A18` **Support/impersonation access** — explicit, time-boxed, audited grant type; persistent banner while active | H | 4 | Support access that looks like normal access cannot be investigated afterwards. |
| ☐ | 27 Aug | Dev | Auth | `A19` **Session management UI** — active sessions, device, last seen, revoke; revoke-others after password change | M | 4 | |
| ☐ | 27 Aug | Dev | Tenancy | `T1` **UNIT scope (backend)** — entity, `IUdfScoped`, specificity 16, every resolver, migrations, tests | H | 4 | **Critical path.** Every resolver in one change. |
| ☐ | 28 Aug | Dev | Tenancy | `T1b` **UNIT wiring** — `al.master` endpoints, permission entries, `al.udf` catalogue | M | 3 | Finish before `C4` or `D3` start. |
| ☐ | 28 Aug | Dev | QA | `A20` **Access test matrix** — four Ace users × five scope levels × two applications, asserted end to end | H | 4 | The week's delivery. A suite, not a checklist. |
| ☐ | 28 Aug | Dev | Docs | `A21` **Identity GUIDE.md** + reconcile [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md) with what was built | L | 3 | |

### W3 — Tenancy, ingestion & form builder · 31 Aug – 4 Sep

*Delivery: provision a full organisation and upload validated activity data.*

| ☐ | Date | Dev | Module | Task & subtasks | Cx | Hrs | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☐ | 31 Aug | Dev | Tenancy | `T2` **Tenant provisioning wizard** — details, plan, quota, admin user, review; show `DesiredVersion`/`AppliedVersion` | H | 4 | Provisioning is async and versioned. Not a spinner. |
| ☐ | 31 Aug | Dev | Tenancy | `T3` **Company onboarding (UDF-driven)** — render from `GET /udf/forms/master/Company`; industry reveals fields; `split()` | M | 4 | Do **not** hand-code the static half. |
| ☐ | 31 Aug | Dev | UDF | `D1a` **Form builder — placement** — static catalogue + custom definitions, drag to order, colspan, per-application visibility | H | 4 | Mandatory columns cannot be hidden; explain rather than disable. |
| ☐ | 1 Sep | Dev | Tenancy | `T4` **Branch, industry & unit management** — CRUD; several industries per branch; unit tree | M | 4 | Depends on `T1`. |
| ☐ | 1 Sep | Dev | Tenancy | `T5` **Facility / site model** — sites under a branch, with geography, capacity, grid connection | M | 4 | Feeds the emission and offset engines. |
| ☐ | 1 Sep | Dev | UDF | `D1b` **Form builder — labels & i18n** — per-scope override, translation editor with missing-language indicator | H | 4 | Overrides overlay, never substitute. Use `HasTranslation`. |
| ☐ | 2 Sep | Dev | Tenancy | `T6` **Provisioning status console** — snapshot state, retry a failed step, name the step that failed | M | 4 | |
| ☐ | 2 Sep | Dev | Ingestion | `T7` **Data collection forms** — Scope 1/2/3 activity entry, UDF-driven, per site | H | 4 | Bulk upload already exists. |
| ☐ | 2 Sep | Dev | UDF | `D1c` **Form builder — sections & conditions** — section CRUD, step flag, condition builder, **live preview using the real renderer** | H | 4 | A preview that diverges from the renderer is worse than none. |
| ☐ | 3 Sep | Dev | Ingestion | `T8` **Five-layer validation pipeline** — format, schema, type, business rule, completeness | H | 4 | Layer 4 delegates to `al.rules`. Do not build a second evaluator. |
| ☐ | 3 Sep | Dev | Ingestion | `T9` **Data quality & confidence scoring** — per-record score, surfaced on every derived figure | H | 4 | An unscored number in an audited disclosure is a liability. |
| ☐ | 3 Sep | Dev | UDF | `D2` **List-view columns per scope** — `uvt-table` resolution + DataGrid consumption + config UI | H | 4 | "10 columns for one scope, 8 for another." |
| ☐ | 4 Sep | Dev | QA | `T10` **Provisioning end-to-end pass** on a reset database | H | 4 | The week's delivery. |
| ☐ | 4 Sep | Dev | Platform | `T11` **Platform master data console** — industries, applications, services, data types, seed status; gated on `IsPlatform` | M | 4 | Customer tenants must not see the screen at all. |
| ☐ | 4 Sep | Dev | Docs | `T12` **Tenancy + form-builder GUIDE.md** | L | 3 | |

### W4 — Commerce · 7–11 Sep

*Delivery: buy a plan with add-ons and quota, with live pricing, promo, wallet and an invoice.*

| ☐ | Date | Dev | Module | Task & subtasks | Cx | Hrs | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☐ | 7 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C1` **Subscription plans admin** — FREE/TRIAL/PRO/ENTERPRISE, included quota, periodic wallet units | M | 4 | Label rollover "top up to" vs "add on top". False means top-up-to. |
| ☐ | 7 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C2` **Feature management** — FREE/PAID/ADDON/BETA/NOT_ALLOWED, burn rate per feature | M | 4 | Validate sub-cent rates — one rounding to zero makes a paid feature free. |
| ☐ | 7 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C3` **Pricing engine (backend)** — [COST.md](./COST.md) as a server-side calculator | H | 4 | The client never computes a total. |
| ☐ | 8 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C4` **Quota configuration by scope** — allocation, overrides, **ceiling enforcement**, usage bars | H | 4 | Test 1 TB tenant / 25 GB role / 20 & 30 GB users. |
| ☐ | 8 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C5` **Buy flow** — plan compare, quota sliders, add-on picker, live breakdown, promo, confirm | H | 4 | Base, add-ons, discount, tax as separate lines. |
| ☐ | 8 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C6` **Wallet & credits UI** — balance per scope, top-up, burn history, low-balance alert | M | 4 | Wallets resolve nearest-first. Show **which** wallet paid. |
| ☐ | 9 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C7` **Promo codes & discounts** — benefit types, feature targeting, windows, redemptions, refusals | M | 4 | Discounts round **down**; overage rounds **up**. |
| ☐ | 9 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C8` **Payment gateway (backend)** — abstraction, charge, refund, **signature-verified idempotent webhooks** | H | 4 | A retried webhook must not double-charge. |
| ☐ | 9 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C9` **Metering & usage capture** — per-feature events feeding quota, wallet and invoice from one source | H | 4 | Three consumers, one event stream. |
| ☐ | 10 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C10` **Invoice generation (backend)** — line items, discounts, credits, totals, tax; **fixed documented order**; PDF via job | H | 4 | Discount-before-credit changes the total. Pin it. |
| ☐ | 10 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C11` **Payment configuration UI** — gateway per scope, secret references only, test mode, connection check | M | 4 | Never render a stored secret. |
| ☐ | 10 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C12` **Shared vs dedicated infrastructure tier** — infra class drives cost model and provisioning | H | 4 | See [COST.md](./COST.md). |
| ☐ | 11 Sep | Dev | Commerce | `C13` **Invoice UI** — list, detail, line items, download, payment status, retry | M | 4 | If `C8`/`C10` slip, ship read-only. |
| ☐ | 11 Sep | Dev | QA | `C14` **Commerce end-to-end pass** on a reset database | H | 4 | The week's delivery. |
| ☐ | 11 Sep | Dev | Docs | `C15` **Commerce GUIDE.md** + reconcile [COST.md](./COST.md) with what shipped | L | 3 | |

### W5 — Configuration, rules & calculation · 14–18 Sep

*Delivery: build a form, author a rule, dry-run it, and calculate emissions with an audit trail.*

| ☐ | Date | Dev | Module | Task & subtasks | Cx | Hrs | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☐ | 14 Sep | Dev | Config | `D3` **Provider bindings UI** — capability × channel × scope; per-branch selection; **disabled ≠ inherited** | H | 4 | Show the per-channel cost here — SMS is ~100× email. |
| ☐ | 14 Sep | Dev | Rules | `R1` **Condition group builder** — arbitrarily nested AND/OR, JSON preview | H | 4 | Build it reusable — `W1` needs it. |
| ☐ | 14 Sep | Dev | Compliance | `R0` **Extract EU requirements** → `docs/compliance/` | M | 4 | **Flag open questions rather than resolving them.** Compliance sign-off required. |
| ☐ | 15 Sep | Dev | Config | `D4` **Templates & assignments by scope** — import and notification templates, assignment matrix | M | 4 | |
| ☐ | 15 Sep | Dev | Rules | `R2` **Rule assignment by scope** — resource and event, priority, enable/disable, **dry-run** | H | 4 | Without dry-run people test in production. |
| ☐ | 15 Sep | Dev | Rules | `R3` **Rule catalogue fixtures** — encode [RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md](./RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md) as `R1` acceptance tests | M | 4 | `R-FEED-02` and `R-MB-01` are the stress cases. |

### W6 — Workflow, billing & biomethane · 21–25 Sep

*Delivery: a biomethane batch for Ace / islabhasolutions / Spain runs through approval and produces
an invoice and an offset plan.*

| ☐ | Date | Dev | Module | Task & subtasks | Cx | Hrs | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☐ | 21 Sep | Dev | Workflow | `W1` **Stage designer** — stages, transitions, approval config, assignee by role and scope, visual graph | H | 4 | **Reuse `R1`'s condition builder.** Two editors will drift. |
| ☐ | 21 Sep | Dev | Biomethane | `B1` **Batch ledger** — batch, feedstock, origin, intensity, custody, certificate; mass-balance period and site | H | 4 | A batch, not a meter reading, is the unit of account. |
| ☐ | 21 Sep | Dev | Offset | `O1` **Offset measure library** — per-industry measures with cost, abatement, complexity, payback | H | 4 | See [OFFSET.md](./OFFSET.md). |
| ☐ | 22 Sep | Dev | Workflow | `W2` **Time-triggered starts & async failure** — a workflow beginning on a date; a stage reversed later | H | 4 | `W-CERT` and `W-ALLOC`. Saga compensation. |
| ☐ | 22 Sep | Dev | Biomethane | `B2` **GHG intensity calculator** — the Annex VI chain, with per-term provenance | H | 4 | Every term shown and sourced. |
| ☐ | 22 Sep | Dev | Offset | `O2` **Offset plan generator** — `(abatement × ROI) / complexity`; quick wins, medium, long | H | 4 | Rule-based. AI ranking is deferred. |
| ☐ | 23 Sep | Dev | Workflow | `W3` **Runtime monitor** — instances, stage, history, manual advance/cancel **with a required reason** | M | 4 | The only audit trail an override leaves. |
| ☐ | 23 Sep | Dev | Biomethane | `B3` **Claim register** — one cross-register uniqueness point for UDB, GO, ETS and disclosure | H | 4 | Build it **vertical-agnostic**. `R-DC-01` is not disableable. |
| ☐ | 23 Sep | Dev | Offset | `O3` **Offset plan UI** — roadmap view, per-measure detail, branch and location overrides | M | 4 | Measures differ by branch: grid factors, permits, incentives. |
| ☐ | 24 Sep | Dev | Workflow | `W4` **Immutable terminal state** — a locked disclosure no administrator can reopen | H | 4 | `W-CSRD`. |
| ☐ | 24 Sep | Dev | Biomethane | `B4` **PoS & certificate management** — issue, attach, validity, expiry alerting, scheme per scope | H | 4 | A lapsed certificate blocks allocation. |
| ☐ | 24 Sep | Dev | Biomethane | `B5` **Ace vertical slice** — seed islabhasolutions / Spain / biomethane with real rules, workflows, offset plan | H | 4 | The week's delivery, and the demo. |

## Deferred backlog

Not in the window. Each estimated so scheduling stays a decision.

| ID | Item | Est. | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X1` | Live UDB integration | 20h | Needs credentials and the production schema; `B7` shapes the seam. |
| `X2` | ETS1/ETS2 attribution engine | 16h | Obligations begin 2027. `B3` holds the claim uniqueness it depends on. |
| `X3` | Power BI embedding & report designer | 16h | PDF reporting covers W6; embedded analytics is a separate surface. |
| `X4` | AI-ranked offset recommendations | 20h | `O2` is rule-based by design. AI ranking needs outcome data we will not have until pilots run. |
| `X5` | SSO / OIDC tenant configuration UI | 10h | `OidcTokenValidator` exists; not needed for the Ace cohort. |
| `X6` | Reseller billing & tenant revenue splits | 12h | Needs a commercial decision on the split model. |
| `X7` | Digital twin / IT-OT telemetry ingestion | 24h+ | A different ingestion class from batch upload. |
| `X8` | Verticals beyond biomethane (H₂/PtX, CCUS, heat, water, waste) | 20h each | Taxonomy exists, so each is configuration plus a measure library. |
| `X9` | Workflow saga compensation **authoring** UI | 8h | `W2` supports it; authoring via API until then. |
| `X10` | Full accessibility audit | 8h | Do it once the screens stop moving. |
| `X11` | Mobile application | — | The scope model supports it from `A7`; the client is out of window. |

## AI prompts

One per task. Paste into a fresh agent session at the repository root. Each assumes the agent reads
the referenced files first.

Every prompt inherits these **standing rules** — repeat them if the agent drifts:

> Follow `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md`. Never send
> tenant/company/branch/application from the client — they come from the token. Put every
> response-changing parameter in the query key. Reuse `packages/react` components; do not add a
> second component library. Write or update the feature's `GUIDE.md`. Add tests for the decisions,
> not the getters. Do not commit.

### F1 — Design tokens & theme

> Create the Carbon Atlas design token layer in `packages/react/src/theme/`. Define the complete
> light palette as CSS custom properties on bare `:root`; redefine only the changed tokens under
> `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` guarded as `:root:not([data-theme="light"])`, and again under
> `:root[data-theme="dark"]` so an explicit toggle wins in both directions. Never give a colour its
> only definition inside a media query. Include: brand scale (carbon greens + slate), semantic
> surfaces, a distinct accent for commerce surfaces, spacing/density tuned for an all-day operator
> console, and motion tokens that collapse under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Export a `ThemeProvider`
> with a persisted light/dark/system toggle. Add `packages/react/src/theme/README.md` explaining the
> three-state theming rule and why the triple definition is required.

### F2 — App shell

> Build the authenticated app shell in `apps/web/src/components/layout/`. Sidebar with grouped
> navigation, collapsible and responsive; top bar with a scope switcher slot, user menu and command
> palette (⌘K); breadcrumbs derived from the route. **Navigation items must hide when the user lacks
> the permission**, not appear and 403 on click — read effective permissions from the auth context.
> Extend `Sidebar.tsx` and `AppHeader.tsx` rather than replacing them, and **mount the existing
> `TenantSwitcher`** (`apps/web/src/features/auth/components/TenantSwitcher.tsx`) in the top bar — it
> was built and never placed. Add `apps/web/src/components/layout/GUIDE.md`.

### F3 — Error handling & diagnostics

> Build error handling for `apps/web`. (1) A route-level error boundary catching render errors and
> showing a recoverable page rather than a blank screen. (2) Dedicated 403, 404 and 500 pages saying
> what happened and what to do next. (3) A **diagnostic report** action posting to
> `/api/v1/telemetry/diagnostics`: correlation id, route, user agent, app version, and a **redacted**
> snapshot of relevant state. Redaction is the critical part — strip tokens, passwords, emails and
> anything under a `secret`/`password`/`token` key, **recursively**, before the payload leaves the
> browser. Add a unit test proving a nested token is stripped. Create the receiving endpoint in
> `al.telemetry`. Document the redaction contract in the feature's `GUIDE.md`.

### F4 — Model & hook conventions

> Extend `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md` with the request/response model
> convention, using `apps/web/src/api/udf.api.ts` and `useUdfForm.ts` as worked examples. Add a
> scaffold script (`scripts/scaffold-feature.mjs`) generating a feature folder — `GUIDE.md`, `api/`,
> `components/`, `pages/`, `__tests__/` — with the api file, hook file and query-key block already
> shaped correctly. Add a `queryKeys.ts` helper folding the active scope into a key. Add
> `docs/GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md` capturing the house documentation style (what it is for, the decisions and
> what the alternatives cost, how to use it, the pitfalls — see
> `packages/react/src/forms/udf/README.md` for tone), plus a CI check `scripts/check-guides.mjs`
> wired into the lint script that fails when a folder under `apps/web/src/features/` has no
> `GUIDE.md`.

### F5 — Scope context

> Build the scope context in `apps/web/src/features/scope/`. A provider holding
> PLATFORM/TENANT/COMPANY/BRANCH/INDUSTRY/UNIT plus the application, a `useScope()` hook, a scope
> switcher, and persistence across reloads. **Changing scope must invalidate every scope-dependent
> query** — a cache surviving a scope switch shows one company's data under another's heading. Fold
> the scope into query keys via the `F4` helper. Test that switching scope drops the previous scope's
> cached data. Write `GUIDE.md` covering the hierarchy, why application is orthogonal rather than a
> level, and the invalidation rule.

### F7 — Shared UI primitives

> Add to `packages/react/src/shared/`: `PageHeader` (title, description, actions, breadcrumb slot),
> `EmptyState` (illustration slot, heading, body, primary action), `StatTile`, `ScopeBadge` (renders
> which scope level a value came from), `ConfirmDialog`, `Drawer`, and `IllustrationSlot` for inline
> SVG. All theme-token driven, all responsive, none fetching data. Add tests for `EmptyState`'s
> filtered-versus-genuinely-empty distinction — "no users yet" and "no users match *admin*" ask for
> different actions. Update `packages/react/src/shared/README.md`.

### A6 — Membership grant model (backend)

> Replace the implicit access model in `al.master` with a single grant table. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md` first — it specifies the shape.
> `Grant(userId, tenantId, companyId?, branchId?, industryKey?, unitId?, applicationId?, roleId,
> includesDescendants, grantType, validFrom?, validUntil?, status)`. **Null means "everything below",
> not "nothing"** — that is what makes the common cases one row. Migrate `TenantAccess` to
> tenant-level grants and `TenantUserRole` to scoped ones, with `applicationId` null so existing
> behaviour is preserved exactly. Add endpoints for listing and managing grants. Test the four Ace
> users resolve to the same effective access before and after the migration.

### A7 — Application gating

> Enforce per-application access in `al.auth`. A user holding no grant for an application must
> **never receive a token for it** — refuse at `/auth/login` and `/auth/context/switch` rather than
> hiding features in the client. Add an `app` claim to the token, and check it in route
> authorization against the route's allowed applications. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md` § *Application gating* for why this
> belongs on the grant and not on the role. The refusal must be **specific** — "your account is not
> enabled for the mobile app" — not a generic 403, because the user has done nothing wrong and needs
> to know who to ask. Test: web-only user is refused a mobile token; the same user succeeds on web.

### A8 — Effective-access resolver

> Build the effective-access resolver in `al.net.authorization`. Given a user and an active context,
> select the applicable grants (scope matches, application matches, dates valid, status active) and
> resolve: **permissions union, configuration most-specific-wins, explicit denials beat both**. That
> split is the subtle part — a company-level reader plus a branch-level admin must be an admin at
> that branch *and* still a reader elsewhere, which most-specific-wins would silently break. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md`. Use the four Ace users as fixtures, and
> add a test asserting the union behaviour explicitly.

### A9 — Tenant & company chooser

> Build post-login context selection in `apps/web/src/features/auth/`. After sign-in, if membership
> spans more than one tenant, show a chooser; if exactly one, go straight through — a control with
> one option is not a choice. Use the existing `useAccessibleTenants` and `useSwitchContext` hooks.
> Extend to company selection where a tenant grant spans several. Test that the single-tenant path
> renders no chooser at all.

### A10 — Roles UI

> Build role management in `apps/web/src/features/rbac/`. List with scope badges, create, edit,
> clone. Deleting a role that is still assigned must be **refused with the assignment list shown**,
> so the admin can act — follow the UDF definition-delete pattern in `al.udf/Api/UdfEndpoints.cs`.
> Use `DataGrid` for the list and `DataGridFormDialog` for editing. Write
> `apps/web/src/features/rbac/GUIDE.md` covering scope-bound roles and why deletion is guarded.

### A11 — Permission catalogue UI

> Build the permission catalogue viewer in `apps/web/src/features/rbac/`. A resource → action tree
> from `al.master`'s permission catalogue, with search, plus the route-permission rules mapping
> endpoints to permissions. Platform-owned entries are **visible and not editable** — render them
> read-only **with an explanation of why**, rather than silently disabling the control. Read
> `al.master/Data/PermissionCatalogSeeder.cs` for the shape.

### A12 — Membership management UI

> Build grant management in `apps/web/src/features/identity/`. Grant a user access at any scope
> level, for named applications, with validity dates and a grant type. The screen the whole identity
> model exists for — read `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md` first. Use the
> scope picker from `F5`. Make **null-means-everything-below** legible in the UI: an empty company
> field must read as "all companies", not as an unfilled input. Show a user's existing grants across
> every tenant they belong to.

### A13 — Role→permission matrix

> Build the role-permission matrix in `apps/web/src/features/rbac/`. A grid of roles × permissions
> with bulk toggle by row, column and group, distinguishing **explicit** grants from ones
> **inherited** through role hierarchy. Before saving, show a **diff** — added and removed
> permissions, named. A permission matrix saved blind is how privilege quietly creeps. Virtualise
> the grid; the catalogue is large. Test that inherited entries cannot be toggled directly.

### A14 — Effective-permission preview

> Build the effective-permission preview in `apps/web/src/features/rbac/`. Given a user and a chosen
> scope, show what they can actually do **and which grant said so**. The provenance is the feature:
> "what can this person do" is otherwise unanswerable, and "why can they see this" becomes a
> developer question. Resolution is server-side via `A8` — the client must not re-implement
> most-specific-wins. Use the four Ace users from `al.master/Data/AceTenantSeeder.cs` as fixtures.

### A15 — Parent/sub-tenant hierarchy

> Add one-level tenant nesting in `al.master` and the corresponding UI. A `parentTenantId` on the
> tenant, plus `includesDescendants` on a grant — **both are required, and the flag is the important
> one**: a parent tenant existing does not mean every grant in it should reach downward. A parent
> admin reads aggregated sub-tenant data; a sub-tenant sees neither the parent nor its siblings.
> **Aggregation is a read, never a write** — acting *in* a sub-tenant means switching context, so the
> audit trail records who really did it. Test all three directions; the sibling one is the one that
> ships broken.

### A16 — MFA enrolment

> Build MFA in `apps/web/src/features/auth/` over `al.auth`'s existing `MfaEnabled`. TOTP enrolment
> with a QR code, verification, and single-use recovery codes shown once. **Mandatory for admin
> roles**, optional otherwise — the policy resolves per role and per scope, not as a global flag.
> Handle the lost-device path via recovery codes, and make clear at enrolment that the codes are the
> only way back. Test that an admin without MFA is prompted and cannot dismiss it.

### A17 — Users management

> Build user administration in `apps/web/src/features/identity/`. Invite (email, initial grant),
> deactivate, resend invite, and view a user's grants across every tenant they belong to. Use
> `DataGrid`. Deactivation must be reversible and must **not** delete grants — "this person has left"
> and "this person never had access" are different facts, and only the first stays answerable if the
> grants survive.

### A18 — Support/impersonation access

> Add a support access path in `al.master` and `apps/web/src/features/identity/`. A grant with
> `grantType = Support`, a **required** `validUntil`, and a reason recorded at creation. Every action
> taken under it is tagged in the audit log, and a persistent banner shows while it is active. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md` § *Support access*. The alternative — a
> standing grant into every tenant — costs the ability to answer "who looked at this record", which
> is the question asked after an incident.

### A19 — Session management UI

> Build session management in `apps/web/src/features/auth/`. List active sessions with device, IP,
> location and last-seen; revoke one; revoke all others. Offer revoke-all-others after a password
> change — but **do not do it silently**, because it strands the user's other devices with no
> explanation. Read `al.auth`'s `ISessionStore` for the available fields.

### T1 / T1b — UNIT scope

> Add `UNIT` as the narrowest level of the scope hierarchy, below INDUSTRY. In `al.net.packages`: a
> `UnitCatalog` entity under `al.net.entities/Master`; `UnitId` on `IUdfScoped`, `UdfScope`,
> `ProviderBinding`, quota allocation, wallet scope, rule assignment and the grant from `A6`;
> specificity weight **16** in `UdfScopes.Specificity` and every sibling resolver. In
> `Carbon-Atlas-Services`: `al.master` CRUD endpoints, permission catalogue entries, `al.udf`
> catalogue declaration, migrations. **Every resolver that scopes must learn UNIT in this one
> change** — a resolver left behind creates a second resolution order that disagrees with the first,
> and the disagreement surfaces months later. Extend the scope tests to cover unit-beats-branch, and
> add a test asserting every `IUdfScoped` implementation exposes `UnitId`.

### T2 — Tenant provisioning wizard

> Build the tenant provisioning wizard in `apps/web/src/features/tenancy/`. Steps: details, plan
> selection, quota allocation, first admin user, review. Submit to `al.master` provisioning.
> Provisioning is **asynchronous and versioned** (`DesiredVersion` / `AppliedVersion` on the
> snapshot), so show which version is applied and what is still pending rather than an indefinite
> spinner. Handle partial failure by naming the step that failed and offering a retry. Write
> `apps/web/src/features/tenancy/GUIDE.md`.

### T3 — Company onboarding (UDF-driven)

> Build company onboarding in `apps/web/src/features/tenancy/`. Render the form entirely from
> `useUdfForm({ module: 'master', resource: 'Company' })` — **do not hand-code the static fields**;
> the static-field catalogue publishes them and hand-coding defeats the whole design. Selecting an
> industry reveals industry-specific fields via the server's conditions. On submit use `split()` to
> route values to the entity and the custom-field bag. Read `packages/react/src/forms/udf/README.md`
> first. Test with a biomethane selection revealing extra required fields and a manufacturing
> selection not requiring them.

### T4 — Branch, industry & unit management

> Build branch, industry and unit management in `apps/web/src/features/tenancy/`. Branch CRUD;
> assigning one or more industries to a branch (a branch legitimately runs several); a unit tree
> beneath branch + industry. Depends on `T1`. Use `DataGrid` for lists and the scope context for the
> active company. Update the feature `GUIDE.md`.

### T5 — Facility / site model

> Add sites beneath a branch in `al.master` and `apps/web/src/features/tenancy/`. A site carries
> geography (for grid emission factors and local incentives), capacity, and grid connection details.
> This is the entity the emission engine calculates against and the offset engine assesses measures
> for — see `Deliverables/OFFSET.md` on why a measure's value is a property of *(measure × site)*.
> Include a `LocationFactor` record per site: grid factor, energy price, incentive scheme, permit
> regime.

### T6 — Provisioning status console

> Build the provisioning console in `apps/web/src/features/tenancy/`. Snapshot state per tenant,
> which version is desired and which applied, per-step status, and retry for a failed step. **Name
> the step that failed** — "provisioning failed" is unactionable, "storage container creation failed:
> quota exceeded" is a ticket somebody can close.

### T7 — Data collection forms

> Build Scope 1/2/3 activity data entry in `apps/web/src/features/ingestion/`, per site and period.
> UDF-driven so a tenant can add activity fields without a release. Bulk upload already exists
> (`al.ingestion` + `packages/react/src/forms/bulk`) — this is the manual path beside it, and both
> must produce the same validated shape. Read `Deliverables/ARCHITECTURE.md` § 4.2.

### T8 — Five-layer validation pipeline

> Implement the five-layer validation pipeline in `al.ingestion`: (1) format — file type, encoding,
> size; (2) schema — required columns; (3) type — numerics parse, dates valid; (4) business rules;
> (5) completeness — critical fields populated. Each layer reports its own errors so a user is told
> which one rejected them. **Layer 4 delegates to `al.rules`** — building a second rule evaluator
> inside ingestion is how an import accepts a row the API would reject, and the disagreement is
> discovered after the data is in.

### T9 — Data quality & confidence scoring

> Add per-record confidence scoring in `al.ingestion` and `al.carbon`. Score from data source
> (measured / calculated / estimated), method, and completeness. **Surface the score on every derived
> figure**, not just at import — an unscored number in an audited disclosure is a liability, and the
> auditor's first question is how confident you are in the input.

### T11 — Platform master data console

> Build the platform administration console in `apps/web/src/features/platform/`. Manage industries,
> applications, services, UDF data types and view types, and show seeder status per service. **Gate
> the whole feature on the platform tenant** (`TenantCatalog.IsPlatform`) — these are platform-owned
> records and a customer tenant must not see the screen at all, not merely be refused on save.

### C1 — Subscription plans admin

> Build subscription plan administration in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. CRUD over
> `SubscriptionPlan` covering FREE / TRIAL / PRO / ENTERPRISE, included quotas, and periodic wallet
> units. **Label `PeriodicWalletUnitsRollOver` in the UI as "top up to" versus "add on top"** — false
> means top-up-to, and a plan configured on the wrong reading gives away or withholds credits every
> period. Read `al.net.entities/Subscription/SubscriptionPlan.cs` and `Deliverables/COST.md` for the
> plan matrix. Write `apps/web/src/features/commerce/GUIDE.md`.

### C2 — Feature management

> Build feature management in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. CRUD over platform features with
> classification (FREE / PAID / ADDON / BETA / NOT_ALLOWED) and a burn rate per feature — units or
> currency. **Validate against sub-cent rates**: a rate rounding to zero silently makes a paid
> feature free, which is a revenue loss nobody notices. Show the effective cost of a feature per plan.

### C3 — Pricing engine (backend)

> Implement the pricing engine in `al.subscription` from `Deliverables/COST.md`. Compute:
> `platform fee + Σ add-ons + Σ over-allowance consumption × unit price × volume multiplier −
> discount − wallet credits + tax`. **Discounts round down; overage rounds up** — opposite directions,
> both deliberate. **Fix and document the order of operations** (discount before or after credit
> changes the total) and pin it with a test against the worked example in COST.md. Expose a quote
> endpoint the buy flow calls, so **the client never computes a total** — a client figure that
> disagrees with the invoice is a chargeback.

### C4 — Quota configuration by scope

> Build quota configuration in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. Allocate quota per scope level and
> per role/user override, with usage bars. The rule to enforce and make visible: **the sum of
> allocations below can never exceed the ceiling above**. Show remaining headroom at each level and
> warn before an over-allocation is saved. Test fixture: a tenant with a 1 TB subscription
> allocation, a role with 25 GB, and users overridden to 20 GB and 30 GB — the user overrides are
> legal; the sum against the tenant ceiling is what must be checked. Read
> `al.net.data/Authorization/EfQuotaGuard.cs`.

### C5 — Buy flow

> Build the subscription purchase flow in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. Plan comparison, quota
> sliders bounded by plan limits, add-on picker, promo code entry, and a **live price breakdown from
> `C3`** — base, add-ons, discount and tax as separate lines. Handle a rejected promo code
> (`PromoRefusal`) by explaining which rule refused it. Read
> `al.net.entities/Billing/PromoCode.cs`.

### C6 — Wallet & credits UI

> Build wallet management in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. Balances at tenant, company, branch
> and user scope; top-up with a **$50 minimum** (payment fees make smaller top-ups unprofitable —
> see COST.md); burn history with the feature that burned it; low-balance alerting; per-feature
> enablement. Wallets resolve **nearest-first** — show *which* wallet paid for a burn, because "why
> did my branch balance drop" is otherwise unanswerable. Read `al.net.entities/Billing/Wallet.cs`
> and `WalletRef.cs`.

### C7 — Promo codes & discounts

> Build promo code management in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. CRUD with benefit types (percent
> off, amount off, bonus wallet units, rate discount), feature targeting, and time windows. Show
> redemptions and refusal reasons. **Discounts round down while overage rounds up** — surface the
> computed value so an author can see it. Read `al.net.entities/Billing/PromoCode.cs`.

### C8 — Payment gateway (backend)

> Build payment gateway integration as a new `al.net.payments` package, wired into `al.subscription`.
> Provider abstraction over the existing `PaymentProvider` entity, resolved per scope through
> `IProviderBindingResolver` like every other provider. Implement charge, refund and webhook receipt.
> Non-negotiable: **verify the webhook signature before parsing the body**, and make charge and
> webhook handling **idempotent by key** — a retried webhook must not double-charge, and gateways
> retry aggressively. Store no raw card data. Add tests for replayed webhook, out-of-order webhook,
> and signature mismatch. Write `al.net.payments/README.md`.

### C9 — Metering & usage capture

> Build usage metering in `al.subscription`. Emit a per-feature usage event on every billable
> operation, and have quota enforcement, wallet burn and invoice line items **all read from that one
> stream**. Three consumers, one source — two sources of usage will disagree, and the disagreement
> surfaces as an invoice a customer can prove is wrong. Include the scope on every event so usage
> rolls up correctly.

### C10 — Invoice generation (backend)

> Build invoice generation in `al.subscription`. Compose line items from the subscription period,
> per-feature usage (`C9`), quota add-ons and one-off purchases; apply promotional discounts and
> wallet credits; compute totals and tax using `C3`'s documented order of operations. Generate the
> PDF via a background job, **not on the request**. Read `al.net.entities/Billing/Invoice.cs`. Pin
> the order of operations with a test using the worked example in `Deliverables/COST.md`.

### C11 — Payment configuration UI

> Build payment configuration in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. Choose a gateway per scope,
> supply credentials, toggle test mode, and run a connection check. **Never render a stored secret** —
> show the `@secret:` reference and offer replace-only. Follow the provider-binding UI pattern from
> `D3`. Depends on `C8`.

### C12 — Shared vs dedicated infrastructure

> Surface the tenant infrastructure class in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/` and honour it in
> provisioning. `TenantCatalog` already carries `InfraType`, `ConnectionMode` and `DatabaseConfig`,
> so this is a provisioning decision rather than an architectural one. Read `Deliverables/COST.md` §
> *shared vs dedicated* — a dedicated tenant costs 30–50× the incremental of a shared one, so it must
> be priced as an add-on and **never bundled**, or shared tenants subsidise it.

### C13 — Invoice UI

> Build the invoice screens in `apps/web/src/features/commerce/`. List with status filter, detail
> with line items, download, payment status, and retry for a failed payment. Depends on `C8` and
> `C10`; if either slips, ship the list and detail read-only rather than blocking. Reuse the download
> pattern from `apps/web/src/api/useExport.ts` — fetch the link on click, never cache it.

### D1a — Form builder: field placement

> Build the form builder's placement surface in `apps/web/src/features/form-builder/`. Pick a module
> and resource, then show the available fields: the **static-field catalogue**
> (`GET /api/v1/udf/static-fields/{module}/{resource}`) alongside the tenant's custom definitions.
> Drag to order, set column span, set per-application visibility. **Mandatory columns cannot be
> hidden or made optional** — the resolver refuses, so the UI must explain rather than silently
> disable. System-managed keys are shown as not-placeable. Read `al.net.packages/al.net.udf/README.md`
> first. Write `apps/web/src/features/form-builder/GUIDE.md`.

### D1b — Form builder: labels & i18n

> Add label and translation editing to the form builder. Per-scope `labelOverride`, help text,
> tooltip and placeholder, each with a translation editor. Two rules to get right: overrides are
> **overlaid, not substituted** — supplying only English must keep the tenant's Spanish; and the
> missing-translation indicator must use `HasTranslation`, because `Resolve` always succeeds and can
> never tell you something is untranslated. Show a live preview in the selected language. Worked
> example: one branch shows "First Name", another shows "First", and both render "Nombre" in Spanish.

### D1c — Form builder: sections & conditions

> Add sections and conditions to the form builder. Section CRUD with translated title, order,
> collapse and wizard-step flags; a condition builder producing `UdfCondition` (field, operator,
> values) attachable to a field or a whole section. Render a **live preview using the real
> `DynamicForm`**, not a mock — a preview that diverges from the renderer is worse than none.
> Conditions say when a field is *shown* and the client inverts them for `hidden`; use the existing
> `toHiddenRule`, do not write a second inversion. Worked example: selecting biomethane reveals four
> extra fields, and a section-level condition gates all four at once.

### D2 — List-view columns per scope

> Extend UDF to table views. Backend (`al.net.udf` + `al.udf`): let a `UdfViewConfiguration` target
> the `uvt-table` view type so a column set resolves per scope, and add
> `GET /api/v1/udf/views/{module}/{resource}/table` returning resolved columns in order. Frontend:
> have `DataGrid` accept a resolved column set, and build the configuration UI. Requirement to
> satisfy: **one scope sees 10 columns, another sees 8**, from one configuration. Update
> `packages/react/src/datagrid/README.md` — it currently states the grid does not consume UDF.

### D3 — Provider bindings UI

> Build provider configuration in `apps/web/src/features/configuration/`. A matrix of capability
> (notification, storage, cache, telemetry, queue, audit) × channel × scope, letting an administrator
> bind a provider at any level. Worked requirement: for one tenant's biomethane line, branch A uses
> SMS, B WhatsApp, C Teams, D Email and E all of them. Make the distinction between **disabled** and
> **inherited** visible — a disabled binding *suppresses* the capability and does not fall through to
> the parent, which is the behaviour people misread. **Show the per-message cost at the point of
> choosing** — SMS is ~100× email (see `Deliverables/COST.md`), and a branch routing everything to
> SMS turns a profitable account into a loss-making one. Read
> `al.net.data/Registry/EfProviderBindingResolver.cs`. Write
> `apps/web/src/features/configuration/GUIDE.md`.

### D4 — Templates & assignments by scope

> Build template management in `apps/web/src/features/configuration/`. Import templates (columns,
> commit policy, policy-override flag) and notification templates, each assignable per scope, with a
> matrix showing which template wins where. Import templates already resolve by scope in
> `al.ingestion` — this is the authoring UI over it.

### D5 — Preferences & configuration by scope

> Build the preferences console in `apps/web/src/features/configuration/`. Grouped preferences
> settable at any scope level, with a **resolution preview naming which level supplied the effective
> value**. That provenance is the entire value of the screen: a resolved value with no explanation of
> where it came from is unsupportable, and "why is this setting on" becomes a developer question.

### D6 — Audit, telemetry & queue strategy per scope

> Extend the `D3` provider-binding UI to the remaining capabilities: audit sink, telemetry exporter
> and queue provider, each configurable per scope. Same matrix, same disabled-versus-inherited
> distinction. Note that no `IQueueReceiver` implementation exists in the SDK yet — configure the
> binding, and flag the missing implementation rather than stubbing one.

### R0 — Extract EU biomethane requirements

> Produce `docs/compliance/EU_BIOMETHANE.md` from primary sources. Start from
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/EU-BIOMETHANE.md`, which lists what is needed and its open
> questions, and from the sources at the foot of that document. Extract, **with a citation for
> each**: GHG-saving thresholds by installation commissioning date and end use (as transposed in
> Spain); Annex IX Part A and Part B categories and their double-counting treatment, with the Spanish
> Part B cap; the UDB transaction schema and submission window; the ETS2 timeline and obligated
> parties; the ESRS E1 datapoints biomethane affects. **State plainly where sources disagree or leave
> something open rather than resolving it** — a flagged question is useful, a guess presented as fact
> is not. Mark the document as requiring compliance-lead sign-off before any rule is configured from
> it.

### R1 — Condition group builder

> Build a reusable nested condition builder in `packages/react/src/rules/`. Arbitrarily nested AND/OR
> groups, each leaf being field + operator + value(s), with add/remove at any depth and a JSON
> preview. Target expression: `field1 = "abc" AND (field2 = "def" OR field3 = "ghi")` — **nesting is
> the requirement**, not an enhancement. The comparison operand must be able to be a **scope-resolved
> value**, not only a literal — see `Deliverables/RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md` shape 1, the one people
> hard-code. Fields come from the UDF resolved form for the target resource, so a custom field is
> usable in a rule with no code change. **This component is reused by `W1` for workflow transition
> guards — build it to be reused.** Write `packages/react/src/rules/README.md`.

### R2 — Rule assignment by scope

> Build rule management in `apps/web/src/features/rules/`. Attach rules to a resource and event,
> scoped, with priority ordering, enable/disable, and severity (block / flag / warn). Include a
> **dry-run**: paste or pick a sample payload and show which rules match and what they would do.
> Dry-run is what makes rule authoring safe — without it people test in production. Rules marked
> **not disableable** must be enforced in the resolver, not by greying out a checkbox. Rule changes
> are versioned and audited. Read `al.net.rules` and `al.rules`. Write
> `apps/web/src/features/rules/GUIDE.md`.

### R3 — Rule catalogue as acceptance fixtures

> Take the rule catalogue in `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/EU-BIOMETHANE.md` and encode all
> fourteen rules as fixtures for the `R1` condition builder. Each fixture is the rule's condition tree
> as JSON plus payloads that should and should not match. Four are the point of the exercise:
> `R-FEED-02` needs a **nested** boolean over a scope-resolved cap; `R-MB-01` needs an **aggregate
> over a window**; `R-DC-01` must be **non-disableable** — prove the UI cannot switch it off; and
> `R-SLIP-01`/`R-DIG-01` prove the severity split (flag and warn, not block). If the builder cannot
> express any of these, report it as a design defect **now** rather than discovering it during the
> industry build.

### R4 — Rule execution monitor

> Build the rule monitor in `apps/web/src/features/rules/`. What fired, on what record, with what
> outcome and at what severity; filter by rule, scope and period; replay a single evaluation against
> the current rule set. Use `DataGrid`. The replay is what turns "the system rejected my batch" into
> an answerable question.

### E1 — Emission factor service

> Build the emission factor service in `al.carbon`. Third-party lookup (Climatiq / Carbon Interface)
> **behind an interface**, with a local document-store cache as fallback — offline capability and a
> 15× cost reduction on the most-repeated operation in the product (see `Deliverables/COST.md`).
> Lookup keys: geography, sector, activity type, period. Cache entries carry the factor's **version
> and source**, because `E4` snapshots them and a factor revised later must not silently change a
> historical calculation.

### E2 — Scope 1 & 2 calculation

> Implement Scope 1 and Scope 2 calculation in `al.carbon`. Scope 1: fuel combustion, process and
> fugitive emissions. Scope 2: purchased electricity, **location-based and market-based computed and
> stored as two separate values** — never one derived from the other at render time, because both are
> reported figures and a derived one cannot be audited. Apply industry-specific methodology per
> vertical. Read `Deliverables/ARCHITECTURE.md` § 4.4.

### E3 — Scope 3 calculation

> Implement Scope 3 calculation in `al.carbon` across the 15 GHG Protocol categories. Each category
> records its own **method** (spend-based, average-data, supplier-specific) and its own confidence
> score, because they will differ widely within one report and an auditor asks per category. Support
> partial coverage — a customer reporting 6 of 15 categories must be able to say so explicitly rather
> than appearing to report zero for the rest.

### E4 — Audit snapshot

> Add immutable calculation snapshots in `al.carbon`. Every calculation records its activity inputs,
> the emission factors used **with their versions and source**, the methodology, the actor and the
> timestamp. A figure that cannot be reproduced cannot be defended to an auditor, and factors get
> revised. The snapshot is append-only: a recalculation creates a new one rather than mutating the
> old, so "what did we report last year and why" stays answerable.

### W1 — Workflow stage designer

> Build the workflow designer in `apps/web/src/features/workflow/`. Define stages, transitions,
> approval configuration (who approves, by role and scope, and how many), and a visual graph.
> **Reuse the `R1` condition builder for transition guards** — do not write a second one; two
> condition editors will drift and then the same expression means different things in a rule and in a
> workflow. Support a stage owned by an **external party** (a certifier outside the tenant). Read
> `al.net.workflow` and `al.workflow`. Write `apps/web/src/features/workflow/GUIDE.md`.

### W2 — Time-triggered starts & asynchronous failure

> Extend the workflow engine and designer for two patterns it currently cannot express. (1)
> **Time-triggered start** — a workflow that begins because a date arrived, with no user action;
> `W-CERT` starts when a certificate approaches expiry. (2) **Asynchronous stage failure with
> compensation** — a stage completes, then a later external confirmation reverses it; `W-ALLOC` marks
> a volume allocated and the UDB rejects it afterwards, so the workflow must compensate rather than
> simply fail. Read `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md` for both patterns.

### W3 — Workflow runtime monitor

> Build the workflow monitor in `apps/web/src/features/workflow/`. Running instances with current
> stage, full history, and manual advance or cancel. **Require a reason on any manual
> intervention** — it is the only audit trail an override leaves, and "who pushed this through and
> why" is the first question asked afterwards. Use `DataGrid` for the list.

### W4 — Immutable terminal state

> Add a locked terminal state to the workflow engine. `W-CSRD` ends in **Locked**, and locked means
> locked — no administrator, no support grant and no API call reopens it. A filed regulatory
> disclosure that can be edited afterwards is not a filed disclosure. Reopening requires a new
> workflow instance that supersedes the old one, leaving both in the record. Test that every
> privileged path is refused.

### O1 — Offset measure library

> Build the measure library in `al.offset`. `MeasureDefinition` (vertical, mechanism, description,
> default abatement basis) at platform scope, plus `SiteMeasureAssessment` (abatement, capex, opex,
> complexity, feasibility, incentives) **per site** — a measure's value is a property of *(measure ×
> site)*, not of the measure, and getting that backwards produces a plan confidently wrong everywhere
> except where it was calibrated. Seed the biomethane, heat, CCUS, water and waste libraries from
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/OFFSET.md`.

### O2 — Offset plan generator

> Build the plan generator in `al.offset`. Rank measures by `(annual abatement × ROI) / complexity`
> and group into quick wins (0–6 months), medium term (6–18) and long term (18–36). **Rule-based, not
> AI** — AI ranking needs outcome data that will not exist until pilots have run. Support a
> **negative abatement**: electrification on a carbon-intensive grid can raise emissions, and the
> engine must return that rather than clamping to zero. Order the plan reduce → remove → credit, and
> keep credits out of the gross figure.

### O3 — Offset plan UI

> Build the offset plan screens in `apps/web/src/features/offset/`. Roadmap view by horizon,
> per-measure detail with the assessment inputs shown, and branch/location overrides. A plan is
> presented to a board and funded against, so **version and date it** and keep what was recommended
> and on what basis — the same reasoning as the calculation audit snapshot. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/OFFSET.md`.

### B1 — Batch ledger

> Build the batch ledger in `al.carbon`. `Batch` (volume, period, site, status), `Feedstock`
> (category, Annex IX class, origin, quantity), `ChainOfCustody` (mass-balance movements per period
> and site). **A batch, not a meter reading, is the unit of account** — every claim traces to a
> physical volume with a feedstock, an origin, an intensity and a certificate. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/EU-BIOMETHANE.md` § *Data model summary*.

### B2 — GHG intensity calculator

> Implement the RED III Annex VI intensity chain in `al.carbon`:
> `E = eec + el + ep + etd + eu − esca − eccs − eccr`, and the saving against a fossil comparator.
> **Store each term separately with its own provenance** — value, unit, source (measured / default /
> disaggregated default), evidence reference and actor. An auditor does not accept an aggregate; they
> ask which digester, what methane slip was assumed and where each figure came from. Support a
> negative `eec` from manure credits, which can produce savings above 100%. Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/EU-BIOMETHANE.md` § *The GHG intensity calculation*.

### B3 — Claim register

> Build the claim register in `al.carbon`. One `Claim` record per (volume, register, counterparty),
> where register is UDB, Guarantee of Origin, ETS attribution or corporate disclosure. **A volume may
> be claimed once**, and this is the single point every downstream use consults — exactly as
> `EfQuotaGuard` is the single place quota is enforced. Build it **vertical-agnostic**: a captured
> tonne on a biogas upgrader is both a biomethane term and a CCUS asset, so the register cannot live
> inside one vertical. `R-DC-01` reads from it and must not be disableable.

### B4 — PoS & certificate management

> Build certificate and Proof of Sustainability management in `al.carbon` and
> `apps/web/src/features/biomethane/`. Scheme (ISCC EU / REDcert EU) configured per scope; certificate
> number and validity window; PoS issued against a batch and linked to a certificate; expiry alerting
> that starts the `W-CERT` renewal workflow. **A lapsed certificate blocks allocation** (`R-SUS-03`).

### B5 — Ace vertical slice

> Seed the Ace biomethane slice as an on-demand seeder: tenant `ace`, company `islabhasolutions`,
> branch `spain`, industry `biomethane`, units `digester-1`, `upgrading-1`, `injection-point-1`.
> Include a feedstock mix (manure + food processing residues), **two batches — one comfortably above
> threshold and one marginal** so `R-SUS-01` is visible doing its job rather than passing silently, a
> certificate approaching expiry so `W-CERT` fires, one allocation the UDB stub rejects so
> `W-ALLOC`'s compensation path runs, and an offset plan from the measure library. This is the demo:
> make it real, not decorative.

### B6 — ESRS E1 disclosure builder

> Build the disclosure builder in `al.carbon` and `apps/web/src/features/biomethane/`. **Biomethane is
> a low-carbon fuel reducing gross Scope 1 — never an offset netted against gross.** Store gross and
> market-based as two values, attach the methodology reference and its auditor approval to any
> market-based figure (`R-GHG-01`), and end in a **locked** state (`W4`). Read
> `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/EU-BIOMETHANE.md` § *Why this is not a carbon-offset product* —
> the vocabulary matters, because a screen saying "offset" teaches a customer to describe their own
> disclosure incorrectly.

### B7 — UDB submission stub

> Build UDB submission in `al.carbon` behind a provider interface, with a stub implementation. Model
> the transaction shape from raw-material origin to final supplier allocation, a submission queue,
> retry with correction (`W-UDB`), and backlog alerting when the mandated window is at risk
> (`R-UDB-01`). Live integration is deferred (`X1`) — **shape the seam now so it becomes a provider
> swap**, not a rewrite. Reconcile submissions against the `B3` claim register.

### A20 / T10 / C14 / E5 / B8 — End-to-end passes

> Run the week's journey on a **reset database** and fix what breaks. Record every defect in the
> session log; fix P0 only and push P1 to the deferred backlog with an estimate.
>
> - **`A20` Access** — the four Ace users × five scope levels × two applications. Assert each sees
>   exactly what their grant allows and no more, and that a web-only user is refused a mobile token.
>   Build it as a **suite, not a checklist** — it is the regression net for every later access change.
> - **`T10` Provisioning** — tenant → company → branch → industry → unit → site → first admin →
>   upload activity data → validate.
> - **`C14` Commerce** — provision → subscribe → allocate quota → burn a feature → apply a promo →
>   generate an invoice → pay.
> - **`E5` Calculation** — upload → validate → calculate Scope 1/2/3 → snapshot, **including a
>   Spanish-locale run**, which exercises resolution paths a default-locale run never touches.
> - **`B8` Biomethane** — batch → evidence → approval → allocation → claim → disclosure, including
>   the marginal batch that `R-SUS-01` should reject and the allocation the UDB stub rejects.

### A21 / T12 / C15 / E6 — Documentation passes

> Write or update the feature `GUIDE.md` files for the week's work, and reconcile the affected
> document in `Carbon-atlas-webapp/Deliverables/` with what was actually built.
>
> A `GUIDE.md` answers, in order: **what this is for**, **the decisions that shape it and what the
> alternatives cost**, **how to use it**, **the pitfalls**. Not an API dump — the types are the API
> dump. Use `packages/react/src/forms/udf/README.md` as the reference for tone and depth.
>
> - **`A21`** — `features/identity/GUIDE.md`, `features/rbac/GUIDE.md`; reconcile
>   [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md), especially the *What this replaces* section.
> - **`T12`** — `features/tenancy/GUIDE.md`, `features/form-builder/GUIDE.md`,
>   `features/ingestion/GUIDE.md`.
> - **`C15`** — `features/commerce/GUIDE.md`; reconcile [COST.md](./COST.md) against shipped pricing,
>   and replace any placeholder figure that measurement has now given a real value.
> - **`E6`** — `features/rules/GUIDE.md`, `features/carbon/GUIDE.md`; reconcile
>   [RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md](./RULES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md) and fold `R0`'s findings into
>   [EU-BIOMETHANE.md](./EU-BIOMETHANE.md), replacing the ⚠️ working values with sourced ones.

### G1 — Cross-review

> Each developer reviews a track they did not build. Look for the two things self-review misses: a
> rule enforced on the client but not on the server, and a scope or culture parameter missing from a
> query key. Fix P0 defects only; everything else goes to the deferred backlog with an estimate.

### G2 — Documentation sync

> Bring every `GUIDE.md` up to date with what was actually built, update any SDK or service `README`
> touched during the window, reconcile this `Deliverables/` folder — particularly `COST.md` against
> shipped pricing and `EU-BIOMETHANE.md` against `R0`'s findings — and close the session log. The
> `F4` CI check must pass.

### G3 — Code freeze

> Tag the release, write the changelog, produce the **ordered** migration list across all three
> repositories, and write the **rollback plan**. Write the rollback before deploying — nobody writes
> a good one during an incident.

### G4 — Deploy & smoke

> Run migrations in dependency order, run seeders, verify health checks, then run the smoke suite.
> Migration ordering has bitten this project before — follow the local verification notes and do a
> dry run against a reset database first.

### G5 — Handover pack

> Produce the handover: a demo script walking the biomethane slice end to end, known limitations
> stated plainly, the deferred backlog with estimates, and the open decisions still outstanding.

---

## Definition of done

A task is done when **all** of these hold:

1. It builds, type-checks and lints clean.
2. Tests cover the **decisions** — the rules with consequences — not the getters.
3. The feature's `GUIDE.md` exists and reflects what was built.

## Session log

| Date | Who | What landed | Notes for the next session |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-15 | Claude | UDF form-metadata system: per-scope label overrides, `LocalizedText` i18n, tooltips, conditions, sections, static-field catalogue. Bulk import/export pages + `BulkUploadGrid`. DataGrid & bulk READMEs. | SDK `.64` published and consumed. |
| 2026-08-15 | Claude | Auth: `POST /auth/challenge` (single-use, 2 min, identifier-bound, rate-limited, no enumeration); four Ace login identities; single re-challenge on `challenge_invalid`; `ApiError.code` + `error`-body normalisation; `useChangePassword`; `features/auth/GUIDE.md`. | Services 346 tests, web 85, react 152 — all green. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | Login challenge pre-fetch on identifier blur; resend cooldown; `/auth/tenants` + `/auth/context/switch`; `useSwitchContext` (clears the cache, does not invalidate); `TenantSwitcher`. `Deliverables/` folder created with 8 documents. | **`TenantSwitcher` is not mounted** — `F2` places it in `AppHeader`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | Merged the old `DELIVERABLES.md` into this file — prompts, ground truth, conventions, file changes — and deleted it. Moved `INTEGRATION_STANDARD.md` into this folder. | This file is now the only plan. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **Onboarding closed out.** `POST /master/users/onboard` orchestrates identity → applications → invitation → role across the two services; `features/identity/` gives it a UI with a `GUIDE.md`. Added the missing `user-invitation` **and** `user-verification` templates — both were dispatched by name with nothing behind them. Emails now carry a link from `Auth:WebAppUrl` rather than a raw token. `AssignUserRoleAsync` gained `scopePath`. | **Two bugs found while testing it live:** the repeat call wrote a **duplicate role row** (`AssignUserRoleAsync` added unconditionally — now idempotent, verified 3 calls → 1 row), and it stored `/` where seeded rows store NULL, giving one column two spellings of "no path". SDK 407 / services 359 / web 85 / react 152, both .NET repos warning-clean on `--no-incremental`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **SDK `.67` verified — all four Ace users now resolve at their own level.** The `ScopePath` fix reached the services, so Amar (industry-level) works. Extended `LandingScope` to derive **scopePath** too, and `TokenResponse` now returns `companyId` / `branchId` / `scopePath`, so a client sends `x-branch-id` and `x-scope-path` from the login response rather than hard-coding its own scope. | Verified live on `.67`: `/auth/me` OK for tenant-, company-, branch- **and** industry-level users, with nothing hard-coded client-side. Services build warning-clean, 359 tests pass. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **Warning regression fixed.** My three new test files introduced **57 xUnit1051 warnings** (22 SDK, 35 services) into repositories that had been warning-clean — every awaited call needed `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken`. Both repos are clean again on a `--no-incremental` build. | Worth knowing: an *incremental* build reports `0 Warning(s)` because nothing recompiles. **Verify with `dotnet build --no-incremental`** before claiming a repo is clean — I reported clean twice on incremental output before this surfaced. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **End-to-end run of the fresh-environment path. Four real bugs found and fixed.** (1) `al.ingestion` missing from the reset script. (2) `al.ingestion` had **never deployed** — index filters written snake_case against PascalCase columns; migration regenerated. (3) `set-tenant-ace.ps1` missed `ace-biomethane` — the seeder key is per *seeder*, not per service, so Amar's industry never existed. (4) Four new endpoints had **no route-permission rules**, so a valid token got 403. Plus: `al.ingestion` secrets held stale `Password=postgres`. | Verified live: all four users sign in on web; Amar **refused on mobile** (`application_not_enabled`) and refused when the client names no application; nonce replay rejected; wrong password 401 (distinct from 403). |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **Landing scope implemented** (`ILandingScopeResolver`) — login and context-switch now derive company/branch from the user's assignments and stamp company into the token. Without it, three of four users signed in and were refused **every** endpoint, because a company-scoped assignment does not apply to a request naming no company. **SDK fix:** `ApiContextMiddleware` never populated `ScopePath`, so *any* industry- or unit-level assignment resolved to nothing. | `/auth/me` and `/auth/tenants` now OK for tenant-, company- and branch-level users. **Amar (industry-level) still 403 until the SDK is republished** — the `ScopePath` fix is in `al.net.packages` and builds, SDK 407 tests green, but services consume the published package. **Branch travels as `x-branch-id`**: `IssuePair` has no branch parameter. *(Later that day: reviewed and kept as headers — see the decision in [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md#why-branch-and-scope-path-travel-as-headers).)* |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **Local environment setup split in two.** `reset-dev-databases.ps1` now seeds the platform baseline only and creates no tenant; **`al.ingestion` added — it was missing, so a "full reset" left `ace_ingestion` behind**. New `set-tenant-ace.ps1` runs `seed-tenant ace` across **five** services (the old inline version ran two, so identities, rules and workflows were never seeded). `DEV_GUIDE.md` §10 and both READMEs updated. | Migrations verified fresh: one `InitialCreate` per context, **no model drift** on any of the six checked. Both scripts parse clean and are **pure ASCII** — a non-ASCII `.ps1` without a BOM is read as ANSI by Windows PowerShell and smart punctuation decodes into characters the parser treats as quotes. |
| 2026-08-16 | Claude | **`A7` application gating done.** `ApplicationAccessService` + refusal at `/auth/login` **and** `/auth/context/switch` with `application_not_enabled`; `VITE_APPLICATION_ID` sent by the client; Ace web/mobile applications seeded; **Amar seeded web-only** so the control is demonstrated by a real account. `TenantSwitcher` mounted in `AppHeader` and rebuilt as a **two-level cascade** (tenant → company) with last-scope persistence. New `GET /api/v1/master/me/scopes`. New `POST /auth/users/onboard` — identity + tenant access + applications + invitation, idempotent on email. | Services **359** tests (+13), web 85, all builds clean. **Not done:** `A6` grant-table consolidation (`TenantAccess` + `TenantUserRole` still separate — application now lives on `TenantAccess`, which was the blocking gap); the onboarding **UI** and al.master's orchestration of role assignment around `/users/onboard`; invitation email template `user-invitation`. |
| 2026-08-18 | Claude | `F1` design tokens & theme done — full token layer, `ThemeProvider`, README. Real bug found: Tailwind tree-shook an unused token; fixed with `@theme static`. | Verified live by toggling theme and reading computed styles. |
| 2026-08-19 | Claude | F1 re-verified against actual code during a broader dark-mode audit: token layer complete; density/motion/commerce tokens defined but unconsumed anywhere — F2/F7's job. | 255 tests green, no new errors. |
| 2026-08-19 | Claude | Wired F1's motion tokens where they exactly matched existing hardcoded values (`duration-200`/`300`, 38 of 49 occurrences, 20 files) so `prefers-reduced-motion` now has a real effect. Left the rest (no clean match) and Framer Motion (needs new JS) untouched. | Verified via computed style, not just the diff. 255 tests green. |
| 2026-08-19 | Claude | Wired F1's density tokens where they exactly matched (shared `Button` default + shared text input, both 36px = `--control-height-md`). Everything else measured close-but-not-exact — left alone, documented in root `CLAUDE.md` for F2/F7. | Verified via pixel measurement before/after — unchanged. 255 tests green. |

## Pick up here

The authentication track is **complete and verified live**. Nothing is outstanding from it — start on
the W1 roadmap above.

**Decided, do not "fix":** `branchId` and `scopePath` travel as `x-branch-id` / `x-scope-path`
headers rather than token claims. They drive both query filtering and write stamping, but they are
also what permission resolution compares against — so naming a scope you hold no assignment for
resolves **zero permissions** rather than granting anything. A header selects among the assignments
somebody already holds; it cannot fabricate one. Full reasoning, and the two caveats it does not
solve, in [IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md](./IDENTITY-AND-SCOPE.md#why-branch-and-scope-path-travel-as-headers).

**Done and verified on `.67`:**

- `POST /api/v1/master/users/onboard` — one call across two services: identity, application access
  and invitation from al.auth, then the role assignment written by al.master. Verified live end to
  end, including idempotency (three identical calls → **one** role row).
- `user-invitation` and `user-verification` templates now exist. Both were being dispatched by name
  with nothing behind them, failing silently into a log line. Emails now carry a **link** built from
  `Auth:WebAppUrl`, not a bare token.
- Onboarding UI: `features/identity/` with `OnboardUserForm`, `useOnboardUser` and a `GUIDE.md`.
- `AssignUserRoleAsync` gained `scopePath` (industry/unit assignment) and is now **idempotent** —
  it previously wrote a duplicate row on every repeat.

**Environment, if starting cold:**

```powershell
.\scripts\set-dev-secrets.ps1                 # once per machine
.\scripts\reset-dev-databases.ps1 -Deploy -Force
.\scripts\set-tenant-ace.ps1 -Force           # optional demo tenant
```

Then start `al.udf` once. Sign in as any of the four `@ace.local` users; the password is
`Secrets:ace-demo-password` on **al.auth**, or generated and logged on first seed. The seeder hashes
**on create only**, so changing that secret afterwards does nothing until `ace_auth` is recreated.

## Open decisions

Things the team cannot resolve alone. Each blocks something dated.

| # | Decision | Needed by | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Margin target** — 25%, 35% or 45%. Drives every published price in [COST.md](./COST.md). | 7 Sep (`C3`) | Business |
| 2 | **Payment gateway** — Stripe, Adyen or a regional provider. Shapes `C8`. | 7 Sep | Business |
| 3 | **Certification scheme** — ISCC EU, REDcert EU or other, for the Ace slice. | 21 Sep (`B4`) | Compliance |
| 4 | **Data residency** — EU-only for all tenants, or per tenant. ±30% on infrastructure cost. | 10 Sep (`C12`) | Business |
| 5 | **Shared vs dedicated threshold** — which plan tier earns dedicated infrastructure. | 10 Sep (`C12`) | Business |
| 6 | **Compliance sign-off on thresholds** — nothing in [EU-BIOMETHANE.md](./EU-BIOMETHANE.md) becomes a configured rule without it. | 14 Sep (`R0`) | Compliance |
| 7 | **FREE tier at all?** — costs ~$8–25/month per tenant with no revenue. A funnel, not charity: cap it hard or drop it. | 7 Sep (`C1`) | Business |
